I've successfully completed Milestone 2, developing a fully responsive and interactive resume assigned by Sir Ameen Alam.
The resume includes four sections: Personal Info, Education, Experience, and Skills. You can easily toggle between these sections by clicking the buttons.
The design is enhanced with smooth hover effects.

I wanted to complete all the milestones, but unfortunately, my final exams for the 3rd year of IT at the university are currently ongoing.
That's why I couldn't achieve all the milestones.
